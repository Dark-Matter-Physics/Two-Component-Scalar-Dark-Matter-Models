Model with bino-wino-like Z2-odd singlet and triplet fermions as used in 
"Coscattering in micrOMEGAs: a case study for the singlet-triplet dark matter model" 
by G. Alguero, G. Belanger, S. Kraml, A. Pukov, arXiv:2207.nnnnn 

Model input parameters are:
- MG1 : singlet mass parameter m, see eq.(1), in GeV 
- MG2 : triplet mass parameter M, see eq.(1), in GeV
- LAM    : capital Lambda in dim-5 Lagragian, eq.(2), in GeV 
- lmbd   : small lambda in dim-5 Lagragian, eq.(2) 
- kappa  : kappa^\prime in dim-5 Lagragian, eq.(2) 
- kappa2 : kappa in dim-5 Lagragian, eq.(2) 

Default values are LAM=10000, kappa=kappa2=0, lmbd=1e-3 

Additional relevant parameters are (see work/models/vars1.mdl for full list)
fpi     |0.13         |pion decay constant
Mpi     |0.1396       |mass of charged pion
A mass of 7 MeV is introduced for the light quarks (u,d) 
to prevent ~1+ decays into ~o2 plus free quarks instead of pions.

Two sample input files are provided, one for the co-annihilation region (param_coann.par)
and one for the co-scattering region (param_cosc.par).

In addition to the usual example main program (main.c), we provide the user with 
a demo program (demo.c) which shows more of the functionality relevant for 
co-scattering scenarios, i.e. very small DM couplings such that chemical 
equilibrium might not be maintained.

Compilation of executable is launched by 

    gmake  main=<name of your main file>

if gmake is absent, use make. We assume that in such case make works like 
gmake.
